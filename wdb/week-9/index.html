        <h2>WEEK 9</h2>
    </section>
    
    <section class="body-section">
    <p>As opposed to creating a new site such as a blog or news aggregator, I have decided to move forward with my existing portfolio website. Because I plan to actually use this site moving forward as a young professional, I have a personal connection to it and look forward to to enhancing the pages in hopes of having a creatively comprehensive, finished site by the end of the semester. </p>

    <a class="p-a" href="https://markdsikes.com/" target="_blank">MARK D. SIKES</a>
    <p>One of the most inspiring sites as I move forward with my own is the website of interior designer Mark D. Sikes. In particular, I am influenced by the 'Contact' page of his site, which renders as a pop-up over the user's existing page rather than as its own page as seen in the images above. Currently, my site's 'Contact' opens as a seperate page, however due to the lack of information on my current page, I think it could be beneficial for me to enhance my page in a similar way using a pop-up graphic. While I won't be including a business address or phone number at this point, I can use my existing email address and city information for the new, enhanced graphic. Additionally, I like the background opacity effect of the inspiration site as it makes the contact information easier to focus on and read.</p>

    <section class="body-section">
    <a class="p-a" href="https://alexahampton.com/" target="_blank">ALEXA HAMPTON</a>
    <p>Alexa Hampton is my favorite designer of all time, and, naturally, her website is also a major inspiration as I craft my own personal site. I appreciate the site's all-encompassing feeling, with it offering more than just a portfolio of interiors &#40;which, for the record, are wonderful&#41;. Instead, the site offers shopping, reading, resources, etc. The element that I am most concerned with is the 'World' page as seen above in the second and third images. This page offers favorite quotes, links to articles, videos, and more, all curated by the designer.</p>
    <p>While perhaps the most ambitious enhancement, I like the idea of adding a page to my site that has this sort of immersive curation of relevant content from other sources thatI find inspiring. I'm not entirely sure what form it would take from a visual standpoint, however Alexa's page is certainly a jumping-off point. As seen in the third image above, this page utilizes the feature of elements scrolling behind other elements, which I believe was presented as a Bootstrap feature. This is likely something that I am interested in implementing on a pahe like this.</p>

    <section class="body-section">
    <a class="p-a" href="https://www.sarahbartholomew.com/" target="_blank">SARAH BARTHOLOMEW</a>
    <p>A third website by which I am inspired is the site of interior designer Sarah Bartholomew. Due to the large amount of information it presents, I believe that my 'About' page could handle some enhancements as I move forward with the project as it is arguably one of the site's most important pages. I like the presentation of information on Sarah's 'About', as seen in the second image. The layered effect with a change in opacity is inspiring as is the incorporation of the large scale headshot; a combnation that isn't all that different from my existing page, format-wise.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I am considering adding a separate, self-updating 'Instagram' page to my own site &#40;as seen above in the third image&#41; as an alternative to relying on the external widget that exists on my current 'About' page. One element that I would change from Sarah's 'Instagram' page, however, is to present all of the Instagram previews in a square/grid format rather than the varying rectangles as seen on her page. This last enhancement is just an idea, but something to consider adding to my site as I move forward and adjust other elements.</p>
